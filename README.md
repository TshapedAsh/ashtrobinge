# Ashtrobinge

A meme-powered, ultra-fast astro data wrangling toolkit.

Ashtrobinge helps you binge astronomical datasets—download, clean, visualize, and export for ML, with a side of meme energy. Made for astronomers, students, and science goblins who want their results fast and their errors spicy.

## 🚀 Features

- One-liner data downloads from major surveys (Gaia/SDSS first)
- Auto-clean messy data (NaNs, units, etc.)
- Quick plotting: scatter, histogram, CMD, sky maps
- Export to pandas, numpy, or CSV for ML/AI
- Meme-powered logs and errors (because science is fun)
- Built for binging, not baby steps

🙋‍♂️ Why Ashtrobinge?
Because you want your science now—not after three hours wrangling FITS files. Because you deserve a CMD and a dopamine hit.
